Critique Driver UI Card
=======================

General Comment
---------------

1. In-between each section there is the title of the section and a karet pointing ^ up to most likely minimize that area. In my
opionon the section titles should be presented at the top of the section to illustrate what the following content will showcase.
So a simple Contact title with a down karet, which can easily be rotated down.

1. I would change the background-color of the container holding the drivers name to either #3498db or #2980b9. Blue is said to 
be a very relaxing and pleasing color to the eye, so that would be my choice. I used flatuicolors.com for this because they 
offer friendly colors. 

2. Since the drivers name appears up top with the color of white, I would personally bold their name to increase legibility
as well as confidence. 

3. THe labels are all lower case in which I would change only the first letters of each label to uppercase.
