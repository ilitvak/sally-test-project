Critique Driver UI Card
=======================

General Comment
---------------

1. In-between each section there is the title of the section and a karet pointing ^ up to most likely minimize that area. In my
opionon the section titles should be presented at the top of the section to illustrate what the following content will showcase.
So placing the Contact title and all other titles with a down karet (which can easily be rotated down.) above the content will do the trick.  

Contact Section
---------------

1. I would change the background-color of the container holding the drivers name to either #3498db or #2980b9. Blue is said to 
be a very relaxing and pleasing color to the eye, so that would be my choice. I used flatuicolors.com for this because they 
offer friendly colors. 

2. Since the drivers name appears up top with the color of white, I would personally bold their name to increase legibility
as well as confidence. 

3. The labels are all lower case in which case I would change only the first letters of each label to uppercase. 

Pipe Info
---------

1. In this section I would recommend to add a $ sign in front of the quoted rate number. Helps with readability and
avoids any miscommunication / misunderstanding. 

2. Lastly, I would change the label for 'start pref' to 'date pref'.

Docs

1. I would shift the text 'work in progress' left similar to the rest of the content on the page and add a font-awesome or some other library showing a document icon to the right. This would allow the user to see their entire UI Driver Card and give them the option to download it to their computers / emails for safekeeping. I would also color the document icon red, specifically #e74c3c or #c0392b.

Emergency Contact
----------------- 

1. This is a very minor change, but I would change the label 'number' to 'phone' since in the contact section you use the label 'phone'. This is only for consistency purposes.
